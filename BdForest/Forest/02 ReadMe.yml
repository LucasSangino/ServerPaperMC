### DISCLAIMER | FAQ ###
- You need to create game sign by yourself (or use the ingame editor):
        1st line of sign - [TheBridge]
        2nd line of sign - Forest
    That's all!

- You will probably like to change the locations of the lobby and end:
        Therefore just open the In-Game Editor and set new locations
    That's all!    

- Is there some schematic of this map:
        Yes its already on your worldedit folder if you followed the instructions!
